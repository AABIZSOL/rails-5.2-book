= Preface

I write for developers who learn best by following clean and short examples. I
don’t like the idea of coding one big single application throughout a book but
prefer smaller stand-alone code. Therefore, you can skip a couple of
pages or even complete chapters without losing context. On the other hand I'm
asking you a lot of times to create an other new Rails application.

Word of warning: I'm not going to sprinkle CSS beauty anywhere. ;-)

Don’t let people fool you into believing that Ruby on Rails is easy to learn. It
is not! It's one of the best and most effective frameworks to develop web
applications but it is hard to understand in the beginning. The worst mistake of
all is to not learn Ruby before diving into Ruby on Rails. To avoid it this book
starts with the xref:ruby-basics#ruby-basics[basics of Ruby]. You
will not become a Ruby guru after reading it but you’ll understand the basic
ideas and that is most important.
